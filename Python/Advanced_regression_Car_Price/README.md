##  What This Project Demonstrates

| Skill Area | What I Did |
|------------|-----------|
| **Data Analysis** | EDA on 15,915 records across 23 features; distribution analysis, correlation mapping, outlier investigation |
| **Feature Engineering** | Derived 7 new features including `km_per_year`, `power_to_weight`, `engine_efficiency`; converted bundled string columns into count features |
| **Statistical Modelling** | Built OLS Linear Regression, Ridge (L2), and Lasso (L1) with cross-validated hyperparameter tuning |
| **Model Evaluation** | R², MAE, RMSE comparison; residual diagnostics; VIF multicollinearity analysis |
| **Regularisation** | Systematic alpha tuning via GridSearchCV; coefficient comparison and feature elimination analysis |
| **Business Thinking** | Translated model outputs into actionable pricing strategy insights |

##  Results at a Glance

| Model | Test R² | Test MAE | Test RMSE | Features Used |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Linear Regression | 0.9217 | 0.007806 | 0.010465 | All |
| Ridge Regression | 0.9217 | 0.007806 | 0.010463 | All (shrunk) |
| **Lasso Regression** | **0.9215** | **0.007804** | **0.010477** | **All − 5** |

**All three models explain ~92% of used car price variance on unseen data with no overfitting.**

## Key Findings

### What Drives Used Car Prices?

```
Strongest Price Drivers (all models agree):

Age              → #1 depreciation driver — older car = significantly lower price
power_to_weight  → Performance efficiency matters more than raw engine size
Brand / Model    → Premium brands resist depreciation; brand identity is structural
km_per_year      → Usage intensity (not just total km) reflects true wear
Comfort_count    → Equipment richness adds measurable resale value
4WD / Automatic  → Drive configuration and transmission type command premiums
```

### What Did Regularisation Reveal?

- **Ridge** → All features retained; correlated engine variables (`hp_kW`, `Displacement_cc`) slightly stabilised. Multicollinearity is moderate, not harmful.
- **Lasso** → 5 weak/redundant features eliminated (`Displacement_cc`, `total_features`, `age_group_Old`, `owner_category_Medium`, `owner_category_High`). Confirms feature engineering was well-executed.
- **Key insight:** Feature engineering contributed more to the R²=0.92 result than algorithm choice. The baseline OLS model was already optimal.
